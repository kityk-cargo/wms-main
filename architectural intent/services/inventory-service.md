# Minimal Viable Implementation of Inventory Management

To get hands-on quickly, the first prototype should include:

## Product Management
- Add new products
- Update product details (name, category, etc.)
- List all products

## Stock Tracking
- Add stock (inbound operation)
- Deduct stock (outbound operation)
- Get current stock levels for a product

## Basic Location Tracking (Optional, but Useful)
- Store which aisle/bin a product is in
- Move a product between locations
